# Python_application_for_dataMining

1. Oreview:
We aim to achieve a prediction model for improving data analysis and reporting.
The programming language that have been used in order to implement the tool is Python 3.6, because python has many features that attract the data science and data mining community, Python has an array of useful libraries which helps to explore the concepts of data mining in the best way possible. Data mining is all about probability, mathematical optimization, and statistics, which are all made easy by Python.
The Scientific Python Development Environment Spyder 4.1.3 has been used, which is designed by and for scientist, engineers and data analysts. It has many built-in features and abilities. 
Many libraries have been used to implement the tool including sklearn and PyQt5.

2. Description of developed tool: (prototype):
The tool provide a practical and friendly interface for making the whole data mining process  for cancer registries, from data preparation and cleaning and transformation to feature selection to datamining techniques.

3. process:
3.1. Data cleaning.
3.2. Data transformation.
3.3. Feature analysis:includes: information gain calculation and Features selection.
3.4. Data mining: There are three data mining techniques that have been used to be compared which are: SVM, decision tree and neural network.
